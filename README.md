# searching-and-sorting
The repository contains binary search algorithm, quick sort implementation and implementation of an example recursive function. 
Implementation is done in python.
This is part of exercises found on Udacity's course on data structures and algorithm. https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud513

To my future self:-find the bug in quick sort, test3 array is not being sorted.
